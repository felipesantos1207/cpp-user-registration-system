# 🗂️ C++ User Registration System

This is a simple C++ project that simulates a user registration system (similar to a registry office). It allows:

- Registering users with CPF, name, surname, and role
- Consulting users by CPF
- Deleting user data

Data is stored in local text files using basic file I/O operations in C++.

## 💻 Functionalities

1. Register new user
2. Search for a user by CPF
3. Delete a user by CPF
4. Exit system

## 🛠 Technologies

- C++
- File I/O (fopen, fclose, fprintf, fgets, remove)
- Command line interaction

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Compile the file using any C++ compiler:
```bash
g++ -o cartorio src/main.cpp
./cartorio
